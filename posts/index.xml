      <description>Like many others, I often enjoy having youtube or twitch videos playing on the brackground while doing other tasks on the computer, and like most people I would have them conveniently playing on a separate tab of Chrome. Despite the convenience, there are some downside to using Chrome for that purpose like the excessive memory used by the browser, the whole area of the webpage occupied by things other than the video and the lack of an option to keep the video, say, on the corner of the computer screen.</description>

      <description>Did you ever ask yourself what would happen if you tweaked some functions in an R package? Recently, I found myself in a situation where I would like to perform and test some changes to an R package and started looking for ways to easily and clearly register some findings. This pursuit eventually led me to learn more about R environment, after all, whenever you install a package in your system you also add a number of environments associated with that package.</description>

      <description>I would like to use this opportunity to write about some useful patterns to organize your R code. These may be well know to advanced R users, but are left out of most tutorials. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy some useful simple tips for R!
1. Loading R packages The most famous way of loading packages in R is through the library() command. One disadvantage of this option is the fact that an error is thrown if the package is not found in the R environment.</description>

      <description>In this post, I will mention a few R functions that are very useful to manipulate other functions or objects. If you are not acquainted with them, I hope that they open a whole world of possibilities in the R code you develop, as they did for me.
1. Ellipsis Ellipsis (...) may be placed in the definition of a function to substitute multiple values that are given as arguments to that function and are not captured by other argument variables.</description>

      <description>Cheers I will start using this website to share some ideas that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in.
Initially, I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on the tools that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using to perform data analysis and program, in general.
I look forward to your comments.</description>
