I'm a mathematician located in Coimbra, Portugal, with a deep interest in Data Science.

I complected my PhD at Penn State, and am part of the fast growing Talkdesk TDX cluster.

If you're also interested in Data Science, and find something interesting in this website, feel free to get in touch with me!
